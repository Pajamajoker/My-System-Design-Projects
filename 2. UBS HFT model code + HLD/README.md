# High-Frequency Trading Model

This project implements a **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)** model designed to analyze and trade stocks with high potential for profit. By combining **machine learning** and **algorithmic trading** techniques, the model is capable of predicting stock price movements and executing trades with low latency.

## üöÄ Technical Overview

### 1. **Model Architecture**
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
  - **Purpose:** Predict stock price movements over a 5-minute window.
  - **Structure:** 
    - 4 dense layers with increasing neuron counts.
    - **Activation:** Sigmoid function in the output layer for binary classification.
  - **Pre-trained Weights:** Stored in `model_weights.h5`.

### 2. **Trading Execution**
- **C++ Module:** 
  - **Functionality:** Executes buy/sell orders based on CNN predictions.
  - **Focus:** Optimized for **low-latency** execution.
  - **Input:** Stock ticker symbols.
  - **Output:** Trade decisions for stock exchanges.

### 3. **Data Processing**
- **Data Source:** 
  - Collected historical stock data using **yfinance**.
  - **Preprocessing:** Calculated volatility metrics, which serve as inputs for the CNN model.

- **In-memory Cache:** Uses **Redis** to store and access recent predictions rapidly.

### 4. **Execution Layer**
- **C++ Execution Modules** deploy across multiple exchanges to carry out trades.
- **Load Balancer** distributes trading requests for optimal throughput.

### 5. **Monitoring & Logging**
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Powered by **Prometheus** to track system health.
- **Centralized Logging:** Utilizes the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for performance tracking and error diagnostics.

### 6. **Backup and Recovery**
- **Redundancy:** Includes backup systems for critical components.
- **Failover Mechanisms** ensure minimal downtime during system failures.
